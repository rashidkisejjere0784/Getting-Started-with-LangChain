# Getting-Started-with-LangChain

LangChain is a framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs) that can generate and understand natural language. 
It helps developers connect LLMs to data sources and enable them to interact with their environment. 
It also provides solutions for common use cases, such as chatbots, personal assistants, and question answering.
